                <p>I am a student at the University of South Florida, graduating in May of 2019 with
                    a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Astronomy.  I am the Vice President of
                    Internal Affairs for Women in Computer Science and Engineering and the Treasurer
                    of the SCUBA club at USF.

                    During the summer of 2018, I had an internship with JP Morgan & Chase where I did
                    full stack development over a 10 week period.  Since then, I have learned much about
                    what it means to be a full stack developer, including honing my web development skills
                    while continuing to improve my knowledge of algorithms and data structures.  I am fluent
                    in Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Arduino.  I have also been exposed to Python,
                    Ruby, SQL and CQL.

                    When decided that my major was going to be Computer Science, I had never programmed a day in my life.
                    Perhaps I was a little na√Øve, but I was part of the generation that grew up in love with computers.
                    Technology has always amazed me, even from a young age I thought that programmers were the modern
                    day equivalent of wizards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first year of college was mostly prerequisites, but I took an elective called "Intro to Programming" which
                    taught Python.  To this day I will never forget sitting in my dorm room and programming for the first time;
                    those famous words of "Hello World" forever changed my life.  I was hooked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there I began to get intimidated, I realized I had to get a job at the end of all this.  I was no longer
                    going to be judged on hard work and merit but I also had to fight to show people that I not only was a good
                    programmer, but I was also all those buzzwords that companies like to hear.  Words like "leadership" and
                    "experience".  The professional world was foreign and terrifying.  For a good
                    year I was content with putting my head down and doing the schoolwork, hoping that an opportunity would will
                    itself into existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got an email in the October following two semesters of plateauing, from a club I was in called Women in
                    Computer Science and Engineering (WICSE).  It was about a hackathon that JP Morgan & Chase was hosting and I
                    decided to sign up.  I had never been to a hackathon before and I was really intimidated by the idea, but I
                    thought that I would just go and try to have a good time even if I didn't do well in the hackathon.  After that
                    hackathon I got an offer from JP Morgan & Chase for a summer internship and I was ecstatic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over winter break after accepting my internship from JPMC, I got a text from a friend saying that WICSE was
                    looking for a new marketing chair since the previous one graduated.  I had absolutely zero experience running
                    a club, but I agreed to do it.  Next thing I know I'm giving an Arduino workshop and it becomes the highest
                    attended meeting of the semester; with a fear of public speaking banished.  At the end of that Spring semester,
                    I was elected Vice President of Internal Affairs for the 2018-2019 school year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My internship began in the summer of that year, and it was a terrifyingly incredible experience and my first
                    in the industry.  At the time, I had zero experience with web development and databases, but my project for
                    those 10 weeks depended almost entirely on those things.  In the end, I finished the project and it was a
                    resounding success, and that is why it was so crushing that I didn't get an offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For once, going out of my comfort zone and my personal philosophy was wrong.  Still though, I had a lot to look
                    forward to in the following fall semester.  In that semester I got even more motivated in WICSE with my promotion.
                    I kickstarted the WICSE Mentorship program to help incoming freshman, I gave presentations to local Middle Schoolers
                    and High Schoolers to introduce them to computer science, I gave two more Arduino Workshops, I pursued
                    more personal projects and tackled larger projects in academia.  Even in SCUBA Club I was diving out of my comfort
                    zone by leading dives.  Looking back, if I had gotten an offer from JPMC, I probably would not have improved
                    as much as I did this last semester, and I probably would have plateaued again.  Even though the improvement
                    was not immediate, my personal philosophy still held.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hold true to my personal philosophy because it totally defines all success I have.  From that na√Øve freshman
                    programming in Python in her dorm room to who I am now years later, I give my success from stretching the
                    limit of what I can do, and who I am.  To be bold, to dive deeper, to be always striving for success, that is
                    who I am now.
