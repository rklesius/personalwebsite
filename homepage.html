                        Arduino and creating cool gadgets to show off to my friends and family.  I used my first paycheck
                        from my internship to build my own computer so I could learn more about hardware than my programming

                        if the conditions are dangerous.  If half of success is showing up, then the other half must

                    I am a student at the University of South Florida, graduating in May of 2019 with
                    a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Astronomy.  I am the
                    Vice President of Internal Affairs for Women in
                    Computer Science and Engineering (<a href="leadership.html#wicse">WICSE</a>) and
                    the Treasurer of the <a href="leadership.html#scuba">SCUBA club</a> at USF.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the summer of 2018, I completed an internship with <a href="experience.html#work"
                    >JP Morgan & Chase</a> where I did full stack development over a 10 week period.
                    Since then, I have learned much about what it means to be a full stack developer, including
                    honing my web development skills while continuing to improve my knowledge of algorithms
                    and data structures.  I am fluent in <a href="skills.html#back">Java, C, C++, Python</a>,
                    <a href="skills.html#front">HTML, CSS, Javascript,</a> and <a href="skills.html#arduino">Arduino</a>.
                    I have also been exposed to Ruby, SQL and CQL so it would be easy for me to pick those up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about inspiring the next generation of programmers and presenting to kids about
                    how important programming is in today's world as part of WICSE.  Another one of my passions is to inspire other
                    women by showing them the importance of going out of your comfort zone (For example, leading luncheons
                    and workshops for WICSE).  Outside of programming, I also love SCUBA diving: nothing
                    clears your head and relaxes you more than being in the underwater world.

                <p>
                    I was part of a generation that grew up in love with computers: from a young age I regarded
                    programmers as modern-day wizards.  Perhaps I was a little naïve when I decided that my major
                    was going to be Computer Science. At the time programming was as foreign as Klingon and as daunting as
                    brain surgery.

                </p>
                <p>
                    My first year of college was mostly prerequisites, but I took an elective called "Intro to Programming" which
                    taught Python.  To this day I will never forget sitting in my dorm room and programming for the first time:
                    those famous words "Hello World" forever changed my life-I was hooked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there I felt intimidated, I realized I had to get a job at the end of all this.  The professional world
                    was foreign and terrifying.  Being a good programmer wasn't enough; I had to be all those buzzwords that companies like
                    to hear.  Words like "leadership" and "experience". At the time I was content with putting my head down and
                    doing the schoolwork, while hoping that an opportunity would will itself into existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After two semesters of plateauing, I got an email from WICSE. It was about a hackathon that JP Morgan & Chase
                    (JPMC) was hosting, and I decided to sign up. I had never been to a hackathon before: it was intimidating.
                    However, I decided I would go and learn from the experience, even though it was daunting. Despite my fears,
                    my performance at that hackathon prompted JPMC to offer me a summer internship, and I was ecstatic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over winter break, I got a text from a friend saying that WICSE was looking for a new marketing chair
                    due to the previous chair graduating. I had absolutely zero experience running a club, but I agreed to do it.
                    Next thing I know, I'm giving an Arduino workshop, which became the highest attended meeting of the semester-
                    banishing my fear of public speaking. At the end of that semester, I was elected Vice President of Internal
                    Affairs of WICSE for the 2018-2019 school year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My internship began the following summer, and it was a terrifyingly incredible experience as my first
                    step into the industry.  My project for those 10 weeks depended on web development and databases, which at
                    the time I had zero experience in. In the end, I finished the project-it was a resounding success. Which is why,
                    it was so crushing that JPMC did not extend an offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though my personal philosophy, “Going out of your comfort zone is the hardest thing to do and the most
                    effective way to improve”, seemed to falter at the time, it held true. I walked away with a new set of skills,
                    not only pertaining to programming but also to professional development. And, I had the following semester
                    to look forward to! In that semester, I became even more motivated in WICSE with my promotion: I kickstarted
                    the WICSE Mentorship program to help incoming freshman, I gave computer science presentations to local middle
                    schoolers and high schoolers, I gave two Arduino Workshops, and I pursued personal projects and tackled larger
                    projects in academia. Even in SCUBA Club, I was diving out of my comfort zone by leading dives. Looking back,
                    if I had gotten an offer from JPMC, I probably would not have improved as much as I had this last semester,
                    and I probably would have plateaued again. Even though the improvement was not immediate, my personal philosophy
                    still held.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My personal philosophy defines all of my success. From that naïve freshman programming in Python to the confident
                    programmer I am today, I have been shaped by going out of my comfort zone. Defying my fears, I have pursued my goals.
                    My success is from going beyond what I think I can do, driving myself to improve along the way. I can confidently say
                    that, “To be bold, to dive deeper, to always strive for success” that is who I am.
