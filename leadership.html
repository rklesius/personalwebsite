        <h2>Women in Computer Science and Engineering at USF</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-11 col-xs-12 mx-auto">
                <p>
                    insert description of WICSE
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I had been a member of Women in Computer Science and Engineering(WICSE) since I started at USF, in January of 2018 they
                    were looking for a new Marketing Chair to make fliers and post on social media for their club, and I happily obliged.
                    What I thought was going to be a fun position turned into a passion I didn't realize I had: to lead. I really enjoyed
                    meetings where we discussed potential events and the future of the club, I found a voice for myself among more distinguished
                    peers and I found that people valued what I said, and I took that and ran with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After vocalizing a need for student-driven meetings where members of the club could learn in a more relaxed and informal
                    setting than with companies presenting during meetings; I had the opportunity to give an Arduino Workshop.  I gave this workshop
                    because the previous semester I taught a class called Makecourse at USF, a class that involved programming a robot in Arduino
                    and anyone at USF could take.  During that class I realized that many people who take that class are mechanical engineers or
                    electrical engineers who have zero programming experience, and the class kind of throws you in the deep end.  To remedy this,
                    I taught programming in the context of Arduino for people that have never coded before.  I even emailed the professor teaching
                    the course to let all his students know about my workshop, as it was specifically designed for them. My workshop turned out to
                    be the highest attended meeting of the year.  It was my first time ever giving a workshop and people were engaged and asking
                    questions.  It was proven to me that if you put purpose behind what you do, then people will take notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of that semester I was elected as Vice President of Internal Affairs, a role which entrusted me with the duties
                    of the WICSE Mentorship program, student-led workshops, and giving announcements during meetings.  In the beginning of each
                    semester we host a social to help all the members of the club meet each other, and during this it's my job to create engaging
                    icebreakers.  To kickoff Fall of 2018, I had a list of descriptions (i.e. "Has worked in an Agile Workplace", "Has built their own
                    computer", "Whose favorite language is Java") and everyone had to find someone to meet those descriptions.  In our first meeting
                    of the Spring semester in 2019, I had "Buzzword Bingo" where tech acronyms and terms (i.e. "TDD", "IoT", "Big Data") were placed
                    at random on a Bingo board and I said definitions of those things until someone got Bingo.  I had a lot of fun creating these
                    events and challenging myself to find interesting ways to engage people and promote social interaction in a way that feels natural.
