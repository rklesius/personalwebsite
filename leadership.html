                    Leadership to me means leading by example, and connecting to people no matter what the circumstance or
                    context.  It means always being prepared, being a role model to young kids who love technology but have
                    no idea how it works, and leading others to enjoy a new language and a new tool. I have learned leadership
                    through being a leader at the University of South Florida; by being the Vice President of Internal Affairs
                    for Women in Computer Science and Engineering and through being the Treasurer of the SCUBA diving club.

        <h3>Women in Computer Science and Engineering at USF</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-11 col-xs-12 mx-auto">

                    Women in Computer Science and Engineering (WICSE) is a club at the University of South Florida that promotes women in tech.
                    Most of the meetings involve companies coming in and giving a workshop about the kinds of technology they use at their company,
                    including everything from teaching languages to test driven development.  They also host resume workshops, Agile trainings,
                    mock interviews, and luncheons with companies.  WICSE also has lots of programs to give back and help students work together
                    such as Engineering Expo, mentorship, and the WICSEkids program.  For more information on this club, you can
                    <a href="http://wicse.cse.usf.edu/" target="_blank">visit the WICSE website</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I had been a member of WICSE since I started at USF, in January of 2018 they
                    were looking for a new Marketing Chair to make fliers and post on social media for their club, and I happily obliged.
                    What I thought was going to be a fun position turned into a passion I didn't realize I had: to lead. I really enjoyed
                    meetings where we discussed potential events and the future of the club, I found a voice for myself among more distinguished
                    peers and I found that people valued what I said, and I took that and ran with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After vocalizing a need for student-driven meetings where members of the club could learn in a more relaxed and informal
                    setting than with companies presenting during meetings; I had the opportunity to give an Arduino Workshop.  I gave this workshop
                    because the previous semester I taught a class called Makecourse at USF, a class that involved programming a robot in Arduino
                    and anyone at USF could take.  During that class I realized that many people who take that class are mechanical engineers or
                    electrical engineers who have zero programming experience, and the class kind of throws you in the deep end.  To remedy this,
                    I taught programming in the context of Arduino for people that have never coded before.  I even emailed the professor teaching
                    the course to let all his students know about my workshop, as it was specifically designed for them. My workshop turned out to
                    be the highest attended meeting of the year.  It was my first time ever giving a workshop and people were engaged and asking
                    questions.  It was proven to me that if you put purpose behind what you do, then people will take notice.
                </p>
                <img class="in-txt-img" src="img/arduino-pres2.jpg" alt="Arduino Workshop"> <br>
                <p>
                    At the end of that semester I was elected as Vice President of Internal Affairs, a role which entrusted me with the duties
                    of the WICSE Mentorship program, student-led workshops, and giving announcements during meetings.  In the beginning of each
                    semester we host a social to help all the members of the club meet each other, and during this it's my job to create engaging
                    icebreakers.  To kickoff Fall of 2018, I had a list of descriptions (i.e. "Has worked in an Agile Workplace", "Has built their own
                    computer", "Whose favorite language is Java") and everyone had to find someone to meet those descriptions.  In our first meeting
                    of the Spring semester in 2019, I had "Buzzword Bingo" where tech acronyms and terms (i.e. "TDD", "IoT", "Big Data") were placed
                    at random on a Bingo board and I said definitions of those things until someone got Bingo.  I had a lot of fun creating these
                    events and challenging myself to find interesting ways to engage people and promote social interaction in a way that feels natural.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another one of my duties as the Vice President of Internal Affairs is with the WICSE mentorship program, where it is my duty to
                    pair mentors with mentees and to encourage them to meet with regularity.  This is something that really means a lot to me, since
                    I think that guidance and encouragement in your early years of programming can really make a difference, especially when it comes
                    to confidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite things about being a WICSE officer is the opportunity to inspire young women to be a part of tech and to take
                    the plunge into the vast world of computer science through the WICSEkids program.  In 2018, I got an opportunity to present to a
                    club at a high school called <em>She Can Stem</em> and to participate in
                    <a href="https://www.usf.edu/engineering/cse/newsroom/12142018-wicseteachin.aspx?fbclid=IwAR2bRSvckDvy-tTeNcZkQB9a33-mame5h0Krkbld_B6B2KQxSHEqcCvo2oc" target="_blank">

                    </a>
                    at a middle school.  Giving presentations to kids is vastly different from interested adults, and I was challenged to be creative
                    and engaging.  Relating to them is really key, and I have fine tuned a great deal of comedy to keep them engaged.  One of the first
                    questions I pose is "What is computer science?" and after everyone gives their interpretations I say "I don't know, lets Google it!"
                    After showing the Google results, I can point out some the different parts of the web page that a computer scientist coded, to show
                    them how much necessity there is for it in something as simple as a Google search.  Another thing I ask them to do is write me an
                    algorithm for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a classic learning tactic.  They submit their response on a google form and I go
                    through them and poke holes in all of the responses.  Then I move on to a more real world example, a web page that gives the smallest
                    amount of coins for a given amount of change.  It is very simply written using Javascript, HTML, and CSS, but it shows them some actual
                    usable code and shows them the thought process you have to go through while you are coding.  Then they have some fun changing the colors
                    of the webpage using CSS.  Finally, I ask them what it takes to become a computer scientist, and I will get answers ranging from "You
                    have to know how to code" to "You have to want to do it" but my last slide just says "This slide was intentionally left blank".  If
                    you would like to see the code for my presentation, I have a <a href="https://github.com/rklesius/WICSEkidsPresentation" target="_blank">

                    When you grow up in Florida, it is hard to not fall in love with water.  I've been a SCUBA Diver for the past three years and nothing
                    clears my head more than being 100ft below the surface in an underwater cavern; where all you hear is your breath and all you think
                    about is the dive.  In the end of the Spring semester in 2018, I was elected as treasurer of the SCUBA Diving Club, a position that
                    I signed up for out of passion and a desire to bring people together over this sport that I love.  For our first dive of the Fall
                    semester, I got the opportunity to lead a drift dive down Rainbow River.  This meant trying to communicate with over 20 people down
                    a fast flowing river with lots of boat traffic and lots of easy to miss cool spots using only hand gestures and banging on my air
                    tank with my dive knife.  Needless to say, it was a very different leadership experience then what I am used to, but everyone had
                    a safe dive and we got to see all the hot spots.
